		<p class="paragraph"> THis is my first coding project working with CSS/HTML. This project will function as a type of blog for what I learn and a place where I can practice my skills. I am working on Sublime Text. This project was started on 4/28/20</p>

		<h2 id="eone">Entry ONe</h2>

		<h3 class="date">Date: 4/28/20</h3>

		<p class="paragraph"> I have completed several Khan Academy courses online and I am very much enjoying the new skills that I have learned up until this point. I enjoy that every other lesson switches from HTML to CSS, so that I am learning both of the languages at a steady pace. I hope that I continue to enjoy this journey and continue to learn the programming of a computer</p>
